# Introduction.
Simple_shell is a Holbertonschool's project by Hellerdejanuar and Labalabadie, we intended to make a shell with simple functions.

It was coded using vi/vim text editors in a Sandbox with Ubuntu 20.04 and comipled using the GNU-gcc compiler with the following flags:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

#3 _simple_shell.c
This is our main function.
